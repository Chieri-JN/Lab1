		<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong> Who is most susceptible to accidental fatal drug overdoses?</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						One of the first questions that came to mind. The goal of this data analysis is to find and
						understand trends in the data to better address the health crisis. This is why we need to know
						who may be most affected.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong> What are the rates of accidental fatal drug overdoses for each recorded drug?</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>This question presents a lot of potential nuances. <em>Firstly, how do we categorize and bucket the drugs</em>?
						The most obvious way is by the individual drugs themselves. But what about bucketing by drug
						classification, or accessibility to a drug, or is prescription, store bought or over-the-counter?
						<em>Secondly, what conclusions can be drawn from the answering of these questions?</em> There are quite a
						few ways we can explore the data. One that needs to be kept in mind is how one individual
						drug can skew the weight of an entire category.
					</li>
					<li>
						This question was partially inspired by the themes presented in the movie <em> <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180093/"> Requiem for a Dream</a></em>.
						More specifically on how the mother character accidentally became addicted to "poppers" as
						an unfortunate result of a prescription by her doctor.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong> What is the evolution of accidental fatal drug overdoses over the years?</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						How has the number and rates of accidental fatal overdoses changed over the years? Is there an
						increase in the numbers? Is there a decrease? Answering these questions is useful in determining
						the urgency of this health crisis. Another potentially interesting analysis would be the correlation
						with rate of change and events in the county/ state and country.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>What are the rates of combined drug accidental fatal overdoses?</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The goal of this question is to explore the potential risk of combining drugs. For example, can
						two different drugs with lower fatalities respectively result in an increased rate of fatal
						overdoses when combined? Answering this will hopefully help identify what combinations are the
						riskiest.
					</li>
					<li>
						One caveat with this is that there is a lack of nuance on how individual drugs react with each
						other within a person's body. Additionally, the dosage ratio of each drug within an individual
						is also not present. All this data shows is that drug x and drug y were present in the body
						during the overdose.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

		<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				The first step in exploring the data set is to visualize is getting a sense of how the data is distributed.
				This bar chart shows the distribution of the number of accidental fatal overdoses across different age groups.
				As we can observe, the large majority of the entries lie between the ages 30 and 60. This distribution is
				mostly unsurprising. The most interesting thing about the visualization is the spike on the lower end of the age range.
				After filtering the data, we can see that there are spikes occurring from ages 0-2 and ages 12-16.

			<figcaption>
				In the first two visualizations shown above, we add another layer of detail to our data exploration, by splitting the numbers by sex.
				Here we can see that across almost all age groups, males largely outnumber females in the number of accidental fatal overdoses.
				The only exception is within the spike  from age 0-2 we observed before in the previous visualizations. This outlier is illustrated in the third bar chart.

			<figcaption>
				In this visualization, we explore the distribution of overdose cases across each documented race and across each age group.
				As we can observe white people are highly represented which aligns with the overall
				<em><a style="color: blue" href="https://alleghenycontroller.com/data-dashboards/population-change-in-allegheny-county-2010-2020/" target="_blank"> distribution of races</a> </em>
				within the county. The second highly represented racial group are black people, making up a decently size chunk of the pie chart.
				The remaining races make up a much smaller combined percentage of the total cases.
				It should be pointed out that the distributions of each age group fluctuates.

				This along with the following visualizations explore the distribution of cases across the years and months.
				This visualization shows the trend of cases from the earliest documented one in 2007 to the latest one in 2025.
				An interesting thing to observe is the variations in the rate of change between each year. The rate steadily increases from 2007 to 2015 before
				drastically spiking from 2015-2017.

		<h2>Summary</h2>

		<p>
			This analysis focuses on exploring possible trends in a dataset document accidental fatal drug overdoes  in the Allegheny County.
			The initial visualizations focused on how the number of cases were spread across different demographics such as age, sex, and race.
			The next focus was visualizing the number of cases across the years as well as exploring the evolution of the case numbers across
			different age groups across the years. The following explorations focused on comparing the rate of drug combination across each age group
			as well as how many of the cases involved specific combinations counts. Finally, the last set of visualizations explored the top  drugs across all cases
			and across each drug classification.
		</p>
		<p>
			After creating multiple visualizations, a couple of data quality issues become evident. The first one being
			the possible <em>null</em> values in the Race field of the dataset. Another one that required data cleaning,
			was how the drug combinations were tracked. The combinations are track through the <em>combined_od[i]</em> fields
			for i, 1 <= i <= 10. The majority of the entries had most of these fields empty, containing <em>null</em> values.
			When initially trying to visualize the drugs with the most occurrences, the null become the dominating value.
			As such on another iteration it was filtered out.
