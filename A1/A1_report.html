		<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong> Who is most susceptible to accidental fatal drug overdoses?</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						One of the first questions that came to mind. The goal of this data analysis is to find and
						understand trends in the data to better address the health crisis. This is why we need to know
						who may be most affected.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong> What are the rates of accidental fatal drug overdoses for each recorded drug?</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>This question presents a lot of potential nuances. <em>Firstly, how do we categorize and bucket the drugs</em>?
						The most obvious way is by the individual drugs themselves. But what about bucketing by drug
						classification, or accessibility to a drug, or is prescription, store bought or over-the-counter?
						<em>Secondly, what conclusions can be drawn from the answering of these questions?</em> There are quite a
						few ways we can explore the data. One that needs to be kept in mind is how one individual
						drug can skew the weight of an entire category.
					</li>
					<li>
						This question was partially inspired by the themes presented in the movie <em> <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180093/"> Requiem for a Dream</a></em>.
						More specifically on how the mother character accidentally became addicted to "poppers" as
						an unfortunate result of a prescription by her doctor.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong> What is the evolution of accidental fatal drug overdoses over the years?</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						How has the number and rates of accidental fatal overdoses changed over the years? Is there an
						increase in the numbers? Is there a decrease? Answering these questions is useful in determining
						the urgency of this health crisis. Another potentially interesting analysis would be the correlation
						with rate of change and events in the county/ state and country.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>What are the rates of combined drug accidental fatal overdoses?</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The goal of this question is to explore the potential risk of combining drugs. For example, can
						two different drugs with lower fatalities respectively result in an increased rate of fatal
						overdoses when combined? Answering this will hopefully help identify what combinations are the
						riskiest.
					</li>
					<li>
						One caveat with this is that there is a lack of nuance on how individual drugs react with each
						other within a person's body. Additionally, the dosage ratio of each drug within an individual
						is also not present. All this data shows is that drug x and drug y were present in the body
						during the overdose.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
<!--			<li>-->
<!--				<strong>What areas (zip addresses) have higher rates of accidental fatal drug overdoses?</strong>-->
<!--				<ul>-->
<!--					<li>-->
<!--						In other words, are there drug overdose hotspots? If the answer is yes, what could be attributes-->
<!--						of these "neighbourhoods" that impact the rate of accidental fatal drug overdoses?-->
<!--					</li>-->
<!--				</ul>-->
<!--			</li>-->
