		<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong> Who is most susceptible to accidental fatal drug overdoses?</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						One of the first questions that came to mind. The goal of this data analysis is to find and
						understand trends in the data to better address the health crisis. This is why we need to know
						who may be most affected.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong> What are the rates of accidental fatal drug overdoses for each recorded drug?</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>This question presents a lot of potential nuances. <em>Firstly, how do we categorize and bucket the drugs</em>?
						The most obvious way is by the individual drugs themselves. But what about bucketing by drug
						classification, or accessibility to a drug, or is prescription, store bought or over-the-counter?
						<em>Secondly, what conclusions can be drawn from the answering of these questions?</em> There are quite a
						few ways we can explore the data. One that needs to be kept in mind is how one individual
						drug can skew the weight of an entire category.
					</li>
					<li>
						This question was partially inspired by the themes presented in the movie <em> <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180093/"> Requiem for a Dream</a></em>.
						More specifically on how the mother character accidentally became addicted to "poppers" as
						an unfortunate result of a prescription by her doctor.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong> What is the evolution of accidental fatal drug overdoses over the years?</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						How has the number and rates of accidental fatal overdoses changed over the years? Is there an
						increase in the numbers? Is there a decrease? Answering these questions is useful in determining
						the urgency of this health crisis. Another potentially interesting analysis would be the correlation
						with rate of change and events in the county/ state and country.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>What are the rates of combined drug accidental fatal overdoses?</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The goal of this question is to explore the potential risk of combining drugs. For example, can
						two different drugs with lower fatalities respectively result in an increased rate of fatal
						overdoses when combined? Answering this will hopefully help identify what combinations are the
						riskiest.
					</li>
					<li>
						One caveat with this is that there is a lack of nuance on how individual drugs react with each
						other within a person's body. Additionally, the dosage ratio of each drug within an individual
						is also not present. All this data shows is that drug x and drug y were present in the body
						during the overdose.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

				The first step in exploring the data set is to visualize is getting a sense of how the data is distributed.
				This bar chart shows the distribution of the number of accidental fatal overdoses across different age groups.
				As we can observe, the large majority of the entries lie between the ages 30 and 60. This distribution is
				mostly unsurprising. The most interesting thing about the visualization is the spike on the lower end of the age range.
				After filtering the data, we can see that there are spikes occurring from ages 0-2 and ages 12-16.
			</figcaption>

			<img src="viz/viz2.svg" alt="" />
			<img src="viz/viz3.svg" alt="" />
			<img src="viz/viz.svg" alt="" />
			<figcaption>
				In the first two visualizations shown above, we add another layer of detail to our data exploration, by splitting the numbers by sex.
				Here we can see that across almost all age groups, males largely outnumber females in the number of accidental fatal overdoses.
				The only exception is within the spike  from age 0-2 we observed before in the previous visualizations. This outlier is illustrated in the third bar chart.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>


		<figure>
			<img src="viz/viz13.svg" alt="" />
			<img src="viz/race.svg" alt="" />
			<figcaption>
				In this visualization, we explore the distribution of overdose cases across each documented race and across each age group.
				As we can observe white people are highly represented which aligns with the overall
				<em><a style="color: blue" href="https://alleghenycontroller.com/data-dashboards/population-change-in-allegheny-county-2010-2020/" target="_blank"> distribution of races</a> </em>
				within the county (See <a style="color: blue" href="https://data.census.gov/table/DECENNIALPL2020.P2?q=Allegheny+County,+Pennsylvania&t=Race+and+Ethnicity" target="_blank"> 2020 census</a>). The second highly represented racial group are black people, making up a decently size chunk of the pie chart.
				The remaining races make up a much smaller combined percentage of the total cases.
				It should be pointed out that the distributions of each age group fluctuates.

			<img src="viz/2016.svg" alt="" />
			<figcaption>
				This along with the following visualizations explore the distribution of cases across the years and months.
				This visualization shows the trend of cases from the earliest documented one in 2007 to the latest one in 2025.
				An interesting thing to observe is the variations in the rate of change between each year. The rate steadily increases from 2007 to 2015 before
				drastically spiking from 2015-2017. It then drops dramatically in 2018, and steadily increasing from 2019 to 2021. Finally, we can observe an exponential decrease from 2022 till 2025.
				There are quite a few interesting sections to discuss and needing further research. Note that the current numbers for 2025 are not necessarily the most accurate since the current year (2025) has not ended yet.

				In the visualization shown above, there are multiple things to take in. The first one is that we  are
				still exploring the distribution of accidental fatal overdoses across the year, however we have added a new  dimension
				of detail with the age scale. Now this visualization compares how the number of cases have evolved for each age group across the years.
				As we can observe, we still see  the same trends noted previously, such as the spike from 2015-2017 and the majority of cases spanning across
				ages 30-60.

			<figcaption>
				This visualization aims to answer whether there are times during the year, where fatal overdoses are likely to occur.
				What is very interesting is spike in cases from 2015 to 2017 shows up as a "hot streak" or darker band within this visualization.
				Unfortunately, besides the trends we previously observed, there is no conclusive pattern indicating what time of the year is most likely to have
				cases.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>

			<img src="viz/viz10.svg" alt="" />
			<img src="viz/10noCol.svg" alt="" />
			<figcaption>
				One question that arose form exploring the distribution of the cases across different measures (demographic, years, etc)
				was how many of these cases involved more than 1 drug. An interesting thing to observe is the fact that 2-3 drugs were involved
				in a large amount of the cases. One thing to note is that the data does not give any information or context on the amount of each drug present.
				Were they all above the lethal limit? Or did a combination of multiple non-lethal doses result in an accidental overdose? These are a couple of questions
				that would require additional research.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="viz/viz8.svg" alt="" />
			<figcaption>
				This visualization is very similar to the one above, except we add another dimension of age to it. There are similar trends present to the ones we saw previously,
				with the majority of the clustering happening in the age ranges 30-60.
				One thing we can see in this graph that was not visible in the previous one, is that there is that there is a case which involved 10 distinct drugs.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="viz/viz11.svg" alt="" />
			<figcaption>
				This visualization uses the same data points as the one above however the encodings are different. For example, we have doubly encoded the overdose count with the y-axis
				and the size of each point. The scale has also been moved to the x-axis. One thing to comment on about this visualization is that it feels overwhelming as there are a lot of different
				components that need to be put together to make sense of what is being shown.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="viz/viz9.svg" alt="" />
			<figcaption>
				This visualization directly answers the question: <em>What are the drugs with the highest recorded accidental drug overdoses?
			</em> As seen, the top four drugs (Fentanyl, Cocaine, Heroin, Alcohol) largely dominate the number of  accidental fatal overdoses. When trying to pin down the cause of this health crisis
				identifying the top drugs involved is very important.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="viz/viz12.svg" alt="" />
			<figcaption>
				This visualization tries to explore how drug classification relates to the rates of accidental fatal overdoses.
				As we can see, three of the top four drugs we identified in the previous visualization are either Schedule I or Schedule II drugs. This means they
				are drugs that have been <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling" target="_blank">identified to have high potential for abuse</a>.
				It is still worth noting how many overdoses are related to alcohol even though it is an uncontrolled substance but regulated substance.

		<h2>Summary</h2>

		<p>
			This analysis focuses on exploring possible trends in a dataset document accidental fatal drug overdoes  in the Allegheny County.
			The initial visualizations focused on how the number of cases were spread across different demographics such as age, sex, and race.
			The next focus was visualizing the number of cases across the years as well as exploring the evolution of the case numbers across
			different age groups across the years. The following explorations focused on comparing the rate of drug combination across each age group
			as well as how many of the cases involved specific combinations counts. Finally, the last set of visualizations explored the top  drugs across all cases
			and across each drug classification.
		</p>
		<p>
			After creating multiple visualizations, a couple of data quality issues become evident. The first one being
			the possible <em>null</em> values in the Race field of the dataset. Another one that required data cleaning,
			was how the drug combinations were tracked. The combinations are track through the <em>combined_od[i]</em> fields
			for i, 1 <= i <= 10. The majority of the entries had most of these fields empty, containing <em>null</em> values.
			When initially trying to visualize the drugs with the most occurrences, the null become the dominating value.
			As such on another iteration it was filtered out.
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally, throughout this whole analysis I did a lot of exploration of ways to display the same selection of the dataset. Such using a different mark
			or trying to use redundant encoding throughout. This is why a couple of the visualizations are paired with very similar images, as I was not always sure which one was the best.
